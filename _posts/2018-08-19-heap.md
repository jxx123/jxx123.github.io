## Definition

Heap is a tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property.

Binary Heap is a binary tree with two properties:
- Shape Property: it must be a complete binary tree, which means the tree is
  fully filled except the deepest level, if the deepest level is not filled, the
  nodes of the that level are filled from left to right. Here is an example of a
  complete binary tree. **NOTE**: this property guarantees the tree has the
  smallest possible height.

  ```mermaid
  graph TD
  A --> B
  A --> C
  B --> D
  B --> E
  C --> F
  ```
- Heap Property: if P is a parent node of C, then the key (the value) of P is
  either greater than or equal to (in a max heap) or less than or equal to (in a
  min heap) the key of C. Here is an example of max-heap. 

**NOTE**: duplicate is allowed!

  ```mermaid
  graph TD
  A(10) --> B(8)
  A --> C(9)
  B --> D(3)
  B --> E(2)
  C --> F(5)
  C --> G(3)
  ```

## Add and delete methods
### Add an element to the binary heap
Here is the current heap.
  ```mermaid
  graph TD
  A(10) --> B(8)
  A --> C(9)
  B --> D(3)
  B --> E(2)
  C --> F(5)
  ```
  To add 11 to the heap, first add it to the empty node starting from left of the deepest level.
  ```mermaid
  graph TD
    A(10) --> B(8)
    A --> C(9)
    B --> D(3)
    B --> E(2)
    C --> F(5)
    C --> G(11)

    classDef orange fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:4px;
    class G orange
  ```
  If the newly added node is larger than its parent, swap the node with its parent node.
  ```mermaid
  graph TD
    A(10) --> B(8)
    A --> C(11)
    B --> D(3)
    B --> E(2)
    C --> F(5)
    C --> G(9)

    classDef orange fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:4px;
    class C orange
  ```
  Until heap property is satisfied.
  ```mermaid
  graph TD
    A(11) --> B(8)
    A --> C(10)
    B --> D(3)
    B --> E(2)
    C --> F(5)
    C --> G(9)

    classDef orange fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:4px;
    class A orange
  ```
