My name is Jinyu Xie. I am a senior software engineer working on Google Search ranking algorithms, and a Ph.D. in Control Systems and Artificial Intelligence.

This is my blog site to keep my learning notes.

I love building tools. Whenever I found there are no tools that fit my use case nicely, I will start building my own. Here are some of the tools I built:

- [loopquest.ai](https://www.loopquest.ai/), a MLOps Web App for Embodied AI evaluation. I am using it heavily for my offline reinforcemen learning workflows, and I host this on the cloud in case others would like to use it as well.
- [simglucose](https://github.com/jxx123/simglucose/tree/master), a Type-1 Diabetes Simulaotr with OpenAI Gym interface. It seems to be the most popular open-source type-1 diabetes simulator? Here are the [google scholar search results](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=simglucose&btnG=).
- [fireTS](https://github.com/jxx123/fireTS) a multi-variate time series prediction library. There is no python packages that are as usable as [the Matlab one](https://www.mathworks.com/help/ident/ref/arx.html) for system identification and time series prediction. I built a similar one with similar APIs, but take it a mile away to connect the interfaces with different machine learning packages, e.g. `sklearn`, `pytroch`, as the core.
